# Sentiment-and-Network-Analysis-to-determine-Product-Success (iPhone 13)
The project aims to evaluate
a product’s performance and its success by analysing Twitter data to get insights on
various factors like the sentiments of customers on the product from their tweets, the role
of influencers in product marketing, geographical penetration of users mentioning the
product and examining the size of retweet network. In this project, we would be working
on the data of ‘iPhone 13’ which was recently released on September 24th, 2021 and
evaluate its success.
